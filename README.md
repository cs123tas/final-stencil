Let's geddit!

#### [24/11/20 Update]

So we've uploaded a project plan in the readme_stuff folder. It's pretty detailed, though I'm sure we'll deviate from it when we start making this thing.

So in the process of adding in some of the main courses's support code to this project (so we don't have to reinvent the wheel a thousand times), I ended up having to comment out  the dummy.cpp file in the glm/details. No idea what that does; hopefully that won't bite us in the butt later on.
